# Consider rendering MSG file content as MarkDown HTML

The body text seems to be raw and only processed for display by Outlook (?) so we can try to render it as MarkDown to make it look at least somewhat nice.

If this is wrong and we get HTML it will just stay HTML after the MarkDown pass so this isn't risky.
